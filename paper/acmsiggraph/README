Abstract

Seam carving deals with the task of taking an input picture and
resizing it to fit another screen type and aspect ratio. In this paper,
we discuss possible methods to decrease the number of artifacts
intoduced by seam carving, as well as decreasing run time of the
original algorithm by using an image segmentation approach. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate that in every case our method resizes
the image faster and in some cases reduces the number of artifacts
introduced by the original seam carving algorithm.
